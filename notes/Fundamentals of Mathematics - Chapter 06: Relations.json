      "full_text": "A relation from one set to another set can be roughly thought of as a table that lists which elements of the first set relate to which elements of the second set.\n\nFor example, a table could show which students are taking which courses. In this context, we would say a student is **related to** a course if they are enrolled in it.",

      "title": "Formal Definition of a Relation",
      "exam_text": "A binary relation R from a set X to a set Y is a <mark-key>subset of the Cartesian product X × Y</mark-key>. If a pair (x, y) is in R, we write xRy and say 'x is related to y'.",
      "full_text": "A (binary) <mark-key>relation R</mark-key> from a set X to a set Y is formally defined as a **subset of the Cartesian product X × Y**.\n\n• The **Cartesian Product X × Y** is the set of all possible ordered pairs (x, y) where x is from X and y is from Y.\n• The relation R is a specific collection of these pairs that satisfy a certain condition.\n• If the pair (x, y) is an element of R (written as <mark-critical>(x, y) ∈ R</mark-critical>), we can also write this as <mark-critical>xRy</mark-critical> and say that **x is related to y**.\n• If X and Y are the same set (X = Y), the relation is called a **relation on X**.",
      "key_sentence": "A (binary) relation R from a set X to a set Y is a subset of the Cartesian product X × Y.",
      "simple_explanation": "First, imagine every possible pairing between two groups (e.g., every student with every class at a school). That's the 'Cartesian Product'. A 'relation' is just the specific list of pairs that are actually true (e.g., which students are actually enrolled in which classes).",
      "analogy": "Think of a deck of cards. The Cartesian product of {'Ace', 'King'} and {'Hearts', 'Spades'} is {(Ace, Hearts), (Ace, Spades), (King, Hearts), (King, Spades)}.

      "full_text": "Let's apply the formal definition to the student-course example.\n\n• **Set X (Students):** {Nimal, Sarath, Wijay, Fathima}\n• **Set Y (Courses):** {Economics, Marketing Management, Financial Mathematics}\n\nThe relation R, representing the enrollments shown in the table, can be written as a set of ordered pairs:\n\n<mark-critical>R = {(Nimal, Economics), (Wijay, Marketing Management), (Sarath, Marketing Management), (Fathima, Economics), (Wijay, Financial Math), (Sarath, Economics)}</mark-critical>\n\nSince the pair (Nimal, Economics) is in the set R, we can write **Nimal R Economics**.",
      "key_sentence": "The relation R, representing the enrollments shown in the table, can be written as a set of ordered pairs.",
      "simple_explanation": "Instead of a table, we can list all the student-class connections as pairs inside curly braces. This is the formal 'set' that represents the relation.",
